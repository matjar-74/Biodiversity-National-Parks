This data analysis project focuses on studying species observed in selected National Parks in the United States over a 7-day period. The dataset includes records of both non-endangered species and those of some level of concern (OSLOC), including species of concern, threatened species, endangered species, and species in recovery.

Skills used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Analysis Report Construction

Through this analysis, I aim to gain insights into the current state of species protection and identify patterns that could inform future conservation strategies. Specifically, I will explore:

- The total number of species currently under protection.
- The distribution of all observed species across different conservation categories.  
- Trends indicating which species are most at risk of becoming OSLOC.  
- The effectiveness of conservation efforts in aiding species recovery.  
- Identifying species that require immediate attention for conservation.  

By answering these questions, this project will provide valuable data-driven insights into wildlife preservation efforts and help highlight key areas where intervention is most needed.
